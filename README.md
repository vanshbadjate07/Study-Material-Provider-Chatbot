# Study Material Provider Chatbot

## Description

The **Study Material Provider Chatbot** is an interactive chatbot application designed to assist students by answering academic-related questions and suggesting study materials. It uses the **Gemini AI model** to generate intelligent responses and provide accurate information based on user queries. The chatbot is built with **Flask** for the backend, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and it’s designed to provide an engaging user experience.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a message or query into the chat input box and presses "Enter" or clicks the send button.
2. The message is sent to the Flask backend, where it is processed and passed to the Gemini model for a relevant response.
3. The backend sends the AI-generated response back to the frontend, which is then displayed as a message from the chatbot.
4. The interaction continues as the user asks more questions, and the chatbot provides responses accordingly.
